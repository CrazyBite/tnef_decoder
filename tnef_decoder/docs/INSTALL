Installing The TNEF Decoder Plugin
==================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the TNEF Decoder
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf tnef_decoder-1.0-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) (OPTIONAL) Decide if you need to configure the plugin (in
   most cases, you do not) and if so, if you want to store
   the plugin configuration file in the plugin directory or
   in the main SquirrelMail config directory.

   ----- optional -----
   A) To store the configuration file in the plugin directory,
      change into the tnef_decoder directory and copy the
      example configuration file to config.php and edit
      config.php, making adjustments as you deem necessary.

     $ cd tnef_decoder
     $ cp config_example.php config.php
     $ vi config.php

   B) To store the configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
      config directory, change into the tnef_decoder
      directory and copy the example configuration file to
      ../../config/config_tnef_decoder.php and edit
      ../../config/config_tnef_decoder.php, making
      adjustments as you deem necessary.

     $ cd tnef_decoder
     $ cp config_example.php ../../config/config_tnef_decoder.php
     $ vi ../../config/config_tnef_decoder.php
   ----- optional -----

3) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

4) Also, if not being used with SquirrelMail 1.4.10+ or 1.5.2+,
   please verify that you have the "Compatibility" plugin
   installed (but not necessarily activated).

5) Translations are not included in this package.  To get a
   translation, download the language pack needed from:

Upgrading The TNEF Decoder Plugin
=================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the TNEF Decoder
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf tnef_decoder-1.0-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) (OPTIONAL) Only if you originally made any configuration
   changes to the plugin, change into the tnef_decoder
   directory and check your config.php file against the new
   version to see if there are any new settings that you must
   add to your config.php file.

  $ diff -u config.php config_example.php

   If you store your configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
   config directory, adjust this command as follows:

  $ diff -u ../../config/config_tnef_decoder.php config_example.php

   Or simply replace your configuration file with the provided
   example and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step two
   under the installation procedure above).
